We want all our team members to reach a level of excelence for our coding and deliverables, thats why we invest time and resources in reducing the learning curve.

The following table describes the score that each team member has on specific Fermat topics. Our goal is to reach 10 (or at least 9) for every team member.

Meetings, sessions and live hangouts will be organized by the team members with higher points to increase the general knowledge of everyone.
